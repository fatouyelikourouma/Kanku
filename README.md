Static NFT Marketplace

Using the HTML/CSS skills I honed by creating my sneaker brand project (which can be found in my repository), I built out a static site from an idea I had for an NFT Marketplace. I built out the UI from Figma, taking bits and pieces out of other templates to create my unique one. Then, using Bootstrap as a CSS Framework (which made everything 100x easier), I spent a couple days putting the pieces together. Although I have coded other static websites, this the first time that I felt like I "got it". I typed out my code without needing to google a snippet or question every other minute and the grid system finally made 100% sense. Although I'm sure my code isn't 100% clean, it's much clearer than my other projects as I tried to make sure my semantics were clear. 

Overall, this was a fun project with a fun design, and I'm proud of my work.
